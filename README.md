# GPT-2-Discord-Bot -> Updated to 3.5

Creating a realtime, seemless Discord chat bot has never been easier with the help of OpenAI's GPT-2 generative text and NLP API. This powerful tool can be used to generate new, unique content in response to user queries and conversations, allowing you to create an engaging, interactive experience for your Discord users. With GPT-2, you can create a bot that can respond to user inquiries in real-time, making it easier than ever to keep your Discord community active and engaged.

I recently upgraded from GPT-2 to GPT-3.5 for my Discord chat bot, as the dataset parameters are much larger and more sophisticated. This upgrade allows the bot to have an increased understanding of natural language processing, along with an improved ability to generate more accurate responses.
